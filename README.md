# aad-oauth-spa-with-apim
Azure AD authenticated with Oauth to an SPA backed by APIs from APIM. Two Examples

1. Implicit flows with Oauth
2. Authorization flows with Oauth

The main differential will be the SPA itself and how it interacts with APIM (at least that's the theory...)


## Goals
To show a Single Page Application authenticated with AAD using Oauth 2.0 and OIDC, with that same authenticaiton used to authorize relevant backend services.

## Tech Used/Displayed in this demo
1. APIs build on Azure Function Apps
2. APIs served from APIM
3. WebApp hosting SPA
4. Identities registered in App Registrations

## API Design
Basic API from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/howto-protect-backend-frontend-azure-ad-b2c example hosted on Function App

APIM Configured


## APP Registrations

## SPA Code
